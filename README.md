# goit-js-hw-05
This project focuses on practicing core JavaScript concepts such as linear functions, arrow functions, and working with arrays of objects. It includes hands-on exercises with essential array methods like forEach, map, flatMap, filter, find, every, some, reduce, and toSorted.
Concepts Learned and Practiced
Gained a solid understanding of linear functions and arrow functions principles.

Learned how to apply functions in practical scenarios to solve real-world problems.

Developed the ability to work with arrays of objects effectively.

Practiced and implemented essential array methods:

forEach: Iterating over arrays and performing actions on each element.

map: Transforming arrays by applying a function to each element.

flatMap: Mapping and flattening arrays in a single step.

filter: Creating new arrays based on specified conditions.

find: Searching for a specific element that matches a condition.

every: Checking if all elements in an array satisfy a condition.

some: Checking if at least one element in an array satisfies a condition.

reduce: Reducing an array to a single accumulated result.

toSorted: Creating a sorted copy of an array without modifying the original.
